### We're kicking off [**OpenCon London 2017**](http://www.opencon2017.org/opencon_2017_London) with a 
## **`2 track do-athon!`**

There'll be plenty of options to work on a variety of projects according to skills and interest. 

<br>

#### We are continuing with the core theme developed for [OpenCon Berlin 2016](https://annakrystalli.shinyapps.io/OpenConBerlin_reprohack/): 
## the **paper reproducibility hack!** (aka **#ReproHack17**)

We are all excited by the progress made by many to **make their papers fully reproducible by publishing code and data**. We know how challenging it can be so we want to showcase the value of the practice, both for original authors and and as a learning experience for the reproducers. 

Inspired by **Owen Petchey's** [**Reproducible Research in Ecology, Evolution, Behaviour, and Environmental Studies course**](https://github.com/opetchey/RREEBES), where students attempt to  reproduce the analyses and figures of a paper from the raw data, we want to attempt to do the same. While they take a few months over a number of sessions, we only have a day so instead we'll be trying to do the same but with **papers that have also published code**. 

What we love about this approach, and why we think it fits well in the space of a hack, is that it provides a low-pressure environment to actually get working with other people's code and data. Attempting reproduction provides an opportunity to test how reproducible papers are **'out of the box'**, enabling evaluation of how successful current practices are, identifying what worked and where the most pressing weaknessess are.

This is by no means an attempt to discredit work so consent by authors will be sought and their involvement is encouraged. We see reproduction as beneficial scientific activitiy in itself, with useful outcomes for the papers and valuable learning experiences for the participants. We hope to feedback our experiences to authors and of course spread the word on successful practice!

## Plus an **open source hack track**

For folks who want to get their hands dirty **contributing to open source projects for Open Science**, we'll also offer a collaborative coding track. The idea is for participants **to get together to create Open Science tools with a focus on reproducible research**. 

You don't have to be a coder to take part in the hack - **anyone with an interest in creating better tools for Open Science is invited**, from designers and researchers to librarians, project managers, communicators, and so on.

**We offer the opportunity for project leads to submit their projects for work.** Projects can either be for a completely new tool, or build on top of existing work. The only requirement is that you should have something to present at the end of the day, be that a concept, mock-ups or a working prototype.

# ReproHack2017

## **Two ways to get involved:**

### **[Nominate a paper or project](https://goo.gl/forms/DJoAHVDCeWlG92b03)**

We invite nominations **from anyone** and **for any type of open project**. For the #Reprohack, we especially invite authors that would like to **test one of their own papers!** Either way, we encourage proponents to seek consent from the original authors for their nominations. 

[**Current list of proposed papers and projects**](https://annakrystalli.shinyapps.io/OpenConLondon_Doathon/)

<br>


### [**Register as a participant**](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/opencon-london-2017-hackathon-tickets-38843068664)

Join us at the hack to **dig into exciting science**, learn more about **reproducibility**, working with **other people's code and data** and more!


***

## **On the day**

This is the master repo of the hack. We'll collect information on the teams and projects through [issues](https://github.com/OpenCon-London/OpenCon_London-Doathon/issues) in this repo. 

As all OpenCon events, we strive to make this event open and inclusive to all. As such the event is governed by the [OpenCon Code of Conduct](http://www.opencon2017.org/code_of_conduct) and you should read it before participating. By participating, you are expected to uphold this code.



### **Authors**

We encourage authors that are keen, to be available for participants to reach out to for guidance or even just to say hello! We've set up a [**gitter channel**](https://gitter.im/OpenCon-London/OpenCon_London-Doathon) as a public lobby where you can also reach the organisers prior to the hack. You can start discussions through **issues** in each project repo and we've also set up a public, collaborative [**hackpad**](https://public.etherpad-mozilla.org/p/OpenConLondon2017_Doathon).

### **Participants**

#### **1. Project and team selection**

We'll start by discussing the [**papers and projects proposed**](https://annakrystalli.shinyapps.io/OpenConLondon_Doathon/) and form into teams. We want to use github to keep track of the materials produced during the hack so we encourage teams to ensure they have someone with github skills on board. 


#### **2. Create project github repo (if applicable)**

 Individuals teams are requested to **create their own github repo** from which to coordinate individual projects.

#### **3. Register your project**
- Copy the text from the [**project registration issue template**](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/annakrystalli/OpenConBerlin_ReproHack/master/.github/project_reg_tmpl.md).
- [**Create** a new issue](https://github.com/OpenCon-London/OpenCon_London-Doathon/issues/new) in **this** (the OpenCon London ReproHack) repo.
- **Paste** text copied from template.
- **Complete details** and save.

#### **4. Work on your project!**

Collect any materials generated during the hack in your **teams's github repo**. If you're trying to reproduce a paper, we recommend you do this in a **jupyter notebook**, **.rmarkdown** or any other literate programming document type. Here's an examples of such an [**output**](https://rawgit.com/opetchey/RREEBES/master/Beninca_etal_2008_Nature/report/report.html), the [raw Rmd code](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/opetchey/RREEBES/master/Beninca_etal_2008_Nature/report/report.Rmd) (link to [.Rdm file](https://github.com/opetchey/RREEBES/blob/master/Beninca_etal_2008_Nature/report/report.Rmd)) used to create it and the github [directory](https://github.com/opetchey/RREEBES/tree/master/Beninca_etal_2008_Nature) containing materials associated with the reproduction.

### **5. Leave feedback on the ReproHack papers**

Please complete the [**Reproducibility feedback form**](https://goo.gl/forms/EP8h3NydHkLTo8Hk2)



#### Collaborative note taking:

Feel free to contribute thoughts on our collaborative [**hackpad**](https://public.etherpad-mozilla.org/p/OpenConLondon2017_Doathon)
